5.	What cmdlet might you use to set to a PowerShell breakpoint? (Hint: PowerShell-specific nouns are often prefixed with PS.)
6.	You’ve learned that aliases are nicknames for cmdlets. What cmdlets are available to create, modify, export, or import aliases?

10.	Is there a way to run a command on a remote host? (Hint: Invoke is the verb for running something now.)
