Complete the following tasks in PowerShell:
1.	Display a list of running processes.
2.	Test the connection to google.com or bing.com without using an external command like ping.
3.	Display a list of all commands that are of the cmdlet type. (This is tricky—we’ve shown you Get-Command, but you need to read the help to find out how to narrow down the list as we’ve asked.)
4.	Display a list of all aliases.
5.	Make a new alias, so you can run ntst to run netstat from a PowerShell prompt.
6.	Display a list of processes that begin with the letter p. Again, read the help for the necessary command—and don’t forget that the asterisk (*) is a near-universal wildcard in PowerShell.
7.	Make a new folder (aka directory) using the New-Item cmdlet with the name of MyFolder1. Then do it again and call it MyFolder2. Use Help if you’re not familiar with New-Item.
8.	Remove the folders from step 7 in a single command. Use Get-Command to find a similar cmdlet to what we used in step 7—and don’t forget that the asterisk (*) is a near-universal wildcard in PowerShell.
We hope these tasks seem straightforward to you. If so—excellent. You’re taking advantage of your existing command-line skills to make PowerShell perform a few practical tasks for you. If you’re new to the command-line world, these tasks are a good introduction to what you’ll be doing in the rest of this book.
