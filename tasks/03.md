Complete the following tasks from a PowerShell prompt:
1.	Create a new directory called Labs.
2.	Create a zero-length file named /Labs/Test.txt (use New-Item).
3.	Is it possible to use Set-Item to change the contents of /Labs/Test.txt to -TESTING? Or do you get an error? If you get an error, why?
4.	Using the Environment provider, display the value of the system environment variable PATH.
5.	Use help to determine what the differences are between the -Filter, -Include, and -Exclude parameters of Get-ChildItem.
