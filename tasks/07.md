Now it’s your turn. 

This exercise will be about secrets management. 

We have a bunch of sensitive information (passwords, connection strings, etc.) that we need to use in our commands, but we need to keep those secrets in a secure location. We also may want to share those secrets with other members on our team.

The PowerShell team has recently been working on a module called Secrets Management to do just this. It’s a generic module for interacting with any secret store that supports it. Some will be local secret stores like the macOS Keychain, and others will be cloud services like Azure Key Vault and HashiCorp Vault. Your goal is to grab this module, store a secret in your secret store of choice, and then retrieve it.
