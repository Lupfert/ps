# Section 8

We recommend doing the following tasks in order, because they build on each other.
To make this a bit trickier, we’re going to force you to consider how to use the Az.Accounts module (which is included in the Az module).:
• The Get-AzSubscription command has the -SubscriptionName parameter; running Get-AzSubscription -SubscriptionName MySubscriptionName retrieves the subscription with the name MySubscriptionName from your account.
• The Selecet-AZSubscription command has the -Subscription parameter; running Select-AzSubscription -Subscription MySubscriptionName sets the subscription in the context that most commands in the Az.* module use to determine the subscription to use.
• The Get-AzContext command can be used to determine which subscription is selected.

That’s all you need to know. With that in mind, complete the following tasks.
Note You’re not being asked to run these commands. This is more of a mental exercise. Instead, you’re being asked whether these commands will function and why.

1. Would the following command work to retrieve a list of commands from modules that start with Microsoft.*on the current machine? Why or why not? Write an explanation, similar to the ones we provided earlier in this chapter.
Get-Command -Module (Get-Module -ListAvailable -Name Microsoft.* | Select-Object -ExpandProperty name)

2. Would this alternative command work to retrieve the list of commands from the same modules? Why or why not? Write an explanation, similar to the ones we provided earlier in this chapter.
Get-Module -ListAvailable -Name Microsoft.* | Get-Command
3. Would this set the subscription in the Azure context? Consider if Get- AzSubcription retrieves multiple subscriptions.
Get-AzSubscription | Select-AzSubscription
4. Write a command that uses pipeline parameter binding to retrieve the first subscription and set that in the Azure context. Don’t use parentheses.
5. Write a command that uses pipeline parameter binding to retrieve the first subscription and set that in the Azure context. Don’t use pipeline input; instead, use a parenthetical command (a command in parentheses).
6. Sometimes someone forgets to add a pipeline parameter binding to a cmdlet. For example, would the following command work to set the subscription in the Azure context? Write an explanation, similar to the ones we provided earlier in this chapter.
'mySubscriptionName' | Select-AzSubscription
