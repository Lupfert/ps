# Section 9

See if you can complete the following tasks:

1. Display a table of processes that includes only the process names, IDs, and whether they’re responding to Windows (the Responding property has that information). Have the table take up as little horizontal room as possible, but don’t allow any information to be truncated.
2. Display a table of processes that includes the process names and IDs. Also include columns for virtual and physical memory usage, expressing those values in megabytes (MB).
3. Use Get-Module to get a list of loaded modules. Format the output as a table that includes, in this order, the module name and the version. The column headers must be ModuleName and ModuleVersion.
4. Use Get-AzStorageAccount and Get-AzStorageContainer to display all of your storage containers so that a separate table is displayed for storage containers that are accessible to the public and storage containers that are not. (Hint: Piping is your friend . . . use a -GroupBy parameter.)
5. Display a four-column-wide list of all directories in the home directory.
6. Create a formatted list of all .dll files in $pshome, displaying the name, version information, and file size. PowerShell uses the Length property, but to make it clearer, your output should show Size.
