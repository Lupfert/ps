1.	Create a background job that gets all processes that start with pwsh from two computers (use localhost twice if you have only one computer to experiment with).
2.	When the job finishes running, receive the results of the job into a variable.
3.	Display the contents of that variable.
4.	Export the variableâ€™s contents to a CLIXML file.
5.	Get a list of all the services currently running on your local machine and save it in a variable $processes.
6.	Replace $processes with just the bits and print spooler service.
7.	Display the contents of $processes.
