Use regular expressions and operators to complete the following:

1. Get all files in your Windows or /usr directory that have a two-digit number as part of the name.
2. Find all modules loaded on your computer that are from Microsoft, and display the name, version number, author, and company name. (Hint: Pipe Get-module to Get-Member to discover property names.)
3. In the Windows Update log, you want to display only the lines where the agent began installing files. You may need to open the file in Notepad to figure out what string you need to select. You may need to run Get-WindowsUpdateLog, and the corresponding log will be placed on your desktop.
For Linux, find your history log and display the lines where you installed packages.
4. Using the Get-DNSClientCache cmdlet, display all listings in which the Data property is an IPv4 address.
5. If you are on a Linux (or Windows) machine, find the lines of the HOSTS file that contain IPV4 addresses.
