#1 What happens if you run Get-Service | Export-CSV services.csv | Out-File from the console? Why does that happen?

#2 Apart from getting one or more services and piping them to Stop-Service, what other means does Stop-Service provide for you to specify the service or services you want to stop? Is it possible to stop a service without using Get-Service at all?

#3 What if you want to create a pipe-delimited file instead of a comma-separated (CSV) file? You would still use the Export-CSV command, but what parameters would you specify?

#4 Is there a way to eliminate the # comment line from the top of an exported CSV file? That line normally contains type information, but what if you want to omit that from a particular file?

#5 Export-CliXML and Export-CSV both modify the system because they can create and overwrite files. What parameter would prevent them from overwriting an existing file? What parameter would ask you if you were sure before proceeding to write the output file?

#6 Windows maintains several regional settings, which include a default list separator. On U.S. systems, that separator is a comma. How can you tell Export-CSV to use the systemâ€™s default separator, rather than a comma?
