For this lab, you only have one task: run the Networking troubleshooting pack. When you successfully do so, you’ll be asked for an “Instance ID.” Hit Enter, run a Web Connectivity check, and ask for help connecting to a specific web page. Use https://www.kystverket.no/ as your test URL. We hope you’ll get a “No problems were detected” report, meaning you ran the check successfully.

To accomplish this task, you’ll need to discover a command capable of getting a troubleshooting pack, and another capable of executing a troubleshooting pack. You’ll also need to discover where the packs are located and how they’re named. Everything you need to know is in PowerShell, and the help system will find it for you.

That’s all the help you get!
