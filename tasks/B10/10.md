#1 Make a one-to-one connection with a remote computer (or with “localhost” if you only have one computer). Launch Notepad.exe. What happens?

#2 Using Invoke-Command, retrieve a list of services that aren’t started from one or two remote computers (it’s OK to use “localhost” twice if you only have one computer). Format the results as a wide list. (Hint: it’s OK to retrieve results and have the formatting occur on your computer—don’t include the Format-cmdlets in the commands that are invoked remotely.)

#3 Use Invoke-Command to get a list of the top ten processes for virtual memory (VM) usage. Target one or two remote computers, if you can; if you only have one computer, target “localhost” twice.

#4 Create a text file that contains three computer names, with one name per line. It’s OK to use the same computer name, or “localhost,” three times if you only have access to one remote computer. Then use Invoke-Command to retrieve the 100 newest Application event log entries from the computer names listed in that file.
